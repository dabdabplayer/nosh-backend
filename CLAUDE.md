## Claude Code
You have access to Swiggy Builders Club docs - the authoritative source
for Swiggy MCP (Food, Instamart, Dineout). Always consult these before
writing Swiggy code:
 
- Index:      https://mcp.swiggy.com/builders/llms.txt
- Full text:  https://mcp.swiggy.com/builders/llms-full.txt
- Per-page:   append `.md` to any https://mcp.swiggy.com/builders/docs/... URL
 
Tool schemas live under `/docs/reference/{food,instamart,dineout}`.
Error codes live at `/docs/reference/errors`. Auth flow is at
`/docs/start/authenticate`.
 
Rules:
1. Before recommending a tool name, parameter, error code, rate limit,
   or auth flow, fetch the relevant doc and verify.
2. Never invent tool names or parameters. If the docs don't cover it,
   say so and ask.
3. Prefer `.md` page fetches over `llms-full.txt` when you know the
   exact area - it's cheaper on context.

## Use Graphify before grep

This repository is indexed by Graphify: a code graph over its call, dependency, and test structure, exposed through a connected Graphify MCP server. Before reaching for grep or reading files, use the Graphify tools your MCP client lists (their exact names and descriptions are in the server's tool list) for what the graph knows and a text search does not:

- find where a symbol, function, or class is defined (instead of grepping for it)
- understand how something works, or where a behavior is handled
- find who calls a function, or what it calls
- see what a change affects (its blast radius) and which tests cover it
- map a file's dependencies and dependents

Fall back to grep or file reads only for what the graph does not model: literal string or comment matches, non-indexed files, or reading a file you have already located. If no Graphify tools are listed, check the MCP server connection.
